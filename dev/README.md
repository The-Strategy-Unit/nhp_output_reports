# `dev/`

The scripts in this folder are for developments related to new functionality in the main codebase.
This is a discrete place for testing approaches, away from the scripts in `R/`.

We should expect content here to be integrated into the main codebase when ready.
Otherwise, consider moving any scripts here into the [nhp_output_adhocs](https://github.com/the-Strategy-Unit/nhp_output_adhocs) repo, or possibly [nhp_analysis](https://github.com/the-Strategy-Unit/nhp_analysis) if more generic.

By default, any ad hoc work related to outputs (that isn't directly related to producing output reports) should go in the [nhp_output_adhocs](https://github.com/the-Strategy-Unit/nhp_output_adhocs) repo.
